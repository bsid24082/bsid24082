**👋 Hey there, I’m Siddharth Bhardwaj! 🚀**

**🧑‍💻 Code, Coffee, and a Slight Obsession with AI 🤖**

Welcome to my GitHub jungle! 🏗️ You’ll find a mix of **Machine Learning, Data Science, Web Dev, and some random experiments that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM.**
	“It worked on my machine!” - Me, 2024 (and probably forever)

**🔥 What I Do:
	•	📊 Data Science & Machine Learning:** Predicting things before they happen (except my own mistakes).
	**•	🖼️ Image Processing & AI:** Teaching computers to see and understand like humans (but faster).
	**•	🛠️ Web Development:** Building apps that work… most of the time.
	**•	⚡ Open-Source Enthusiast:** Because great ideas deserve to be shared!

**📌 Some of My Favorite Projects:**

🔹 Image-Captioning-Using-Deep-Learning – Making AI describe images like a poet.
🔹 Predictive Modeling for HDI – Predicting the Human Development Index before governments do.
🔹 NBA Player Performance Analysis – Because numbers never lie, but stats sure do. 🏀
🔹 HR Analytics Dashboard – Decoding corporate mysteries, one dataset at a time.

**🛠️ Tech I Work With:**
	**•	ML/DL:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, YOLO, ANN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformers
**•	Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PySpark
	**•	Web Dev:** Django, Flask, HTML/CSS
	**•	Databases:** MySQL, MySQLWorkbench, MongoDB
	**•	Other Cool Stuff:** Git, Docker, Cloud, and Debugging My Own Life
