# 👋 Hey there, I’m Siddharth Bhardwaj! 🚀  

### 🧑‍💻 Code, Coffee, and a Slight Obsession with AI 🤖  

Welcome to my GitHub jungle! 🏗️ You’ll find a mix of **Machine Learning, Data Science, Web Dev, and some random experiments that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM.**    

> *"It worked on my machine!"* - Me, 2024 (and probably forever)
